# CPP ML

I chose to go on adventure to better my cpp skills and learn a bit of machine learning on the way.

On this voyage I am aiming to create a multitude of models and experiments from scratch or as from scratch as I can. I
have collected several cpp and ml books over the time, which I have hyped up for myself but never actually read.
Now I am not completely new to the concepts of cpp and ml. I have studied a variety of ml courses both theoretical and
applied. I canâ€™t say a lot of it has stuck with but it is better than nothing. As for cpp, it has been my main
programming language for about a year and a half, and I aim for it to stay.
